						<p>Alec Ganesha is a self-taught visual artist. He is a first generation American, born and raised in Indianapolis. His father was born in Equador, and his mother was born in Laos. They both struggled with the disease, alcoholism.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Alec attributes the start of it all to when his mother separated from his father, and then moved him and his younger sister to Virginia. He started drawing on his clothes and selling them in middle school as a way to cope with these drastic changes in his life. He eventually moved back to Indiana for his freshmen year of high school. Things were rough and he was failing classes so he moved in with his girlfriend at the age of 15 to focus more on school. He graduated high school and then attended community college for a couple years. Everything changes for Alec in 2014 when his mom passes away unexpectedly.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Creating for Alec was always an outlet for him growing up. He started to paint to help him cope with the pain and he immediately fell in love. His focus and determination comes from the NEED to be able to provide for his siblings. Alec has so much room to grow and this is only the beginning.</p>

					<p>Alec Sebastian Carrillo-Pariseau is a self-taught visual artist, born in Indianapolis, Indiana. His parents immigrated to Virginia during their childhoods, his mother from Laos, and father from Ecuador. You can say it all started when his mother separated from his father, and moved him and his younger sister to Virginia. He started to draw on his clothes and sell them throughout middle school as a way to cope with these drastic changes in his life. Eventually he moved back to Indiana for his freshmen year of high school. A new start. Things got rough and he moved in with his girlfriend at the age of 15 to focus on school. Life goes on; he graduates high school and goes to college at a community school. Everything changed in 2014 when his mom passes away unexpectedly from alcoholism.</p>
					<p>Creating for Alec was always an outlet for him growing up dealing with his alcoholic parents. He started to paint to help him cope with the pain and he immediately fell in love. His focus and determination comes from the <b>NEED</b> to be able to provide for his siblings. Alec has so much room to grow. This is only the beginning.</p>
