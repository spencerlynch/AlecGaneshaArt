    <p>Alec Sebastian Carrillo-Pariseau is a self-taught visual artist, born in Indianapolis, Indiana. His parents immigrated to Virginia during their childhood, his mother from Laos, and his father from Ecuador. You can say it all started when his mother separated from his father, and moved him and his younger sister to Virginia. He started to draw on his clothes and sell them throughout middle school as a way to cope with these drastic changes in his life. Eventually he moved back to Indiana for his freshmen year of high school for a new start. Things got rough and he moved in with his girlfriend at age of 15 to focus on school. Life goes on; he graduates high school and goes to college at a community school. Everything changed in 2014 when his mom passes away unexpectedly from alcoholism. 
    <br>
    Creating for Alec was always an outlet for him growing up dealing with his alcoholic parents. He started to paint to help him cope with the pain and he immediately fell in love. His focus and determination comes from the NEED to be able to provide for his siblings. Alec has so much room to grow and this is only the beginning. </p>
