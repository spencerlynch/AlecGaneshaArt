Alec Ganesha is a self-taught visual artist. He is a first generation American, born and raised in Indianapolis. His father was born in Equador, and his mother was born in Laos. They both struggled with the disease, alcoholism.

Alec attributes the start of it all to when his mother separated from his father, and then moved him and his younger sister to Virginia. He started drawing on his clothes and selling them in middle school as a way to cope with these drastic changes in his life. He eventually moved back to Indiana for his freshmen year of high school. Things were rough and he was failing classes so he moved in with his girlfriend at the age of 15 to focus more on school. He graduated high school and then attended community college for a couple years. Everything changes for Alec in 2014 when his mom passes away unexpectedly.

Creating for Alec was always an outlet for him growing up. He started to paint to help him cope with the pain and he immediately fell in love. His focus and determination comes from the NEED to be able to provide for his siblings. Alec has so much room to grow and this is only the beginning.
